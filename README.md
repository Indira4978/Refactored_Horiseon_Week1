# Refactored_Horiseon_Week1
Refactoring an existing webpage - Week 1 challenge.

## Description

At the end of  the Module 1 of the Front-end developer bootcamp, we are applying the skills gained on HTML by refactoring the source code of a webpage for a marketing agency.

The goal was to make the webpage more accessible by using semantic HTML elements that will improve the navigation. 

I learnt what elements to use in lieu of the generic div element.
